      <p>A tight presidential election in Turkey has left President Erdogan with a slim lead as the opposition seeks to end his two decades of dominance. Meanwhile, an undercover investigation by BBC's Panorama has exposed private ADHD clinics in the UK, where a journalist was diagnosed and given drugs without proper checks. In other news, campaigners are calling for fully-funded counselling services for sex abuse victims, and pupils in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are being assured that their grades will be protected from Covid disruption during A-levels and GCSEs.
