      <p>Navracsics Tibor, Hungary's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has announced that a deal between Hungary and the European Union is very close. Meanwhile, the Hungarian government has issued a new law that affects the Civil Code. The law regarding building rights, which could allow power plants to be built on non-navigable rivers, is also set to be introduced this summer. In other news, the European Parliament delegation has come under fire from the Fidesz-KDNP party for alleged misinformation and attacks against Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. The inflation rate in Hungary continues to outpace wage growth, with the average person losing thousands of forints per month. Finally, the Slovakian government has started to dismantle the fence on its border with Croatia.</p>
